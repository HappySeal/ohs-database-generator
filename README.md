This code is written by Cafer SELLİ for non educational purposes. If I wanna to do something educational I would just learn OHS101


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)  to install bs4 and requests modules if it doesnt exists already.

Open an PowerShell window and type following commands.
```bash
pip install bs4
pip install requests
```
After it is finished installing, download the project to your device.

If you done everything right you are ready to use the program.

## Getting DB file

Open the main.py file by double click or in a PowerShell window

After that you should see a terminal window like that
```
Enter Your User ID:
```
Enter your student id starts with e.

```
Enter Your User ID: e1234567
Enter Your Password: 
```
Enter your metu password. It doesnt shows you to protect from third eyes just like in Unix distros.
After Completeing all of these steps main.py should generate a main.db file in the directory it is located.

Upload it to the Google Form that I gave you.

## Using DB files

In "latest" folder you can find the latest database file I uploaded. It has over 240 questions now. You can submit your own database to expand it

Before you download main.db file you have to install a [SQLite3](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) database explorer. 
After you finish installing it you can open the program and open the main.db file.
